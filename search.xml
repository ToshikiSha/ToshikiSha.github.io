    <content><![CDATA[<p>Why do you volunteer?<br>This may sound a bit strange, but I like that you don’t get paid!  What I mean by that is I can pick it and put it down when I need to.  I don’t have to do it but I get the feel good factor by being involved.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I got involved in volunteering with seescape after my own personal experience. I lost an eye when I was young, and seescape, was on hand to help both myself and my family. Later in life, I lost a percentage of sight in my good eye, again seescape was on hand and helped again.</p>
